Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).

- 2.2 Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge (Automated)
By default, all network traffic is allowed between containers on the same host on the default network bridge. If not
desired, restrict all inter-container communication. Link specific containers together that require communication.
Alternatively, you can create custom network and only join containers that need to communicate to that custom
network.

Remediation: To resolve this, the docker daemon should be configured with icc disabled. Hence, adding the setting
"icc": false to the docker daemon json file.

- 2.15 Ensure live restore is enabled (Automated)
The --live-restore option enables full support of daemon-less containers within Docker. It ensures that Docker does not
stop containers on shutdown or restore and that it properly reconnects to the container when restarted.

Remediation: To resolve this, the docker daemon should be configured with live-restore set to true. Hence, adding the
setting "live-restore": true

- 4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)
Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries.
These signatures allow client-side verification of the identity and the publisher of specific image tags and ensures
the provenance of container images.

Remediation: To resolve this, the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST value should be set to 1.
