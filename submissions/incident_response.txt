1. Incident commander name:
   Zarex Alvin Daria

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   Three crypto mining pods named moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight were launched by an attacker. This resulted to a
   huge spike in the CPU usage and crashed some of the pods.

3. Summary of what was affected:
   The attack affected the Kubernetes cluster. The affected services are the pods hosting Falco, Prometheus, and Grafana.

4. Summary of the impact:
   The attacker managed to run crypto miners on the system and spiked the CPU usage. This crashed the running pods due 
   to the system's incapability of handling the CPU spike.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
  - I ran the following commands to delete the cryptomining pods:
    `kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>`

   I have also deleted all the evicted and crashed pods from all namespaces so that they will be regenerated using the
   command below:
    `kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> -ns <namespace_name>

   I have ensured that all the services have stabilized, are back to normal, and are now accessible.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   - It is good to have a monitoring tool setup like the Grafana dashboards to visualize what is happening in the
     system. It would be helpful to have alerts from Falco in Grafana for events like these.
   - In the falco-exporter metrics pane, which is viewable by visiting 127.0.0.1:9376/metrics from a web browser, new pods creation 
     (i.e. crypto mining pods) will show high priority.
   - High CPU usage could evict and crash some pods and these pods will not get back to their normal state unless deleted and
     regenerated.
